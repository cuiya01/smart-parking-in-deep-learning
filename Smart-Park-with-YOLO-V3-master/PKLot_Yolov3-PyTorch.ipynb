Thanks to [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) for making this simpler.\n","\n","### **Overview**\n","\n","This notebook walks through how to train a YOLOv3 object detection model on your own dataset using Roboflow and Colab.\n","\n","In this specific example, we'll training an object detection model to recognize chess pieces in images. **To adapt this example to your own dataset, you only need to change one line of code in this notebook.**\n","\n","![Chess Example](https://i.imgur.com/nkjobw1.png)\n","\n","### **Our Data**\n","\n","Our dataset of 289 chess images (and 2894 annotations!) is hosted publicly on Roboflow [here](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full).\n","\n","### **Our Model**\n","\n","We'll be training a YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model. This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds.\n","\n","The GitHub repo containing the majority of the code we'll use is available [here](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/yolov3).\n","\n","### **Training**\n","\n","Google Colab provides free GPU resources. Click \"Runtime\" → \"Change runtime type\" → Hardware Accelerator dropdown to \"GPU.\"\n","\n","Colab does have memory limitations, and notebooks must be open in your browser to run. Sessions automatically clear themselves after 12 hours.\n","\n","### **Inference**\n","\n","We'll leverage the `detect.py --weights weights/last.pt` script to produce predictions.
